# Handoff

Read AGENTS.md and PROJECT.md, then the live issue and current branch/check state. Explicit owner direction controls scope. Older helper or issue prose cannot add delivery prerequisites.

## Current work

PR #17 contains the bootstrap contracts. They are not installed on main until merged.
Finish real PCM, CGM, and ACS validation through the public GitHub-hosted workflow.
Then begin #3: Google login, workspace entry, and a simple, aesthetic control dashboard using the frontend approach selected by the owner.

## Delivery

Use PRs and genuine `gates` results on `ubuntu-latest`.
Auto-merge and genuine CI checks are explicitly owner-requested. CI must include contract integrity/integration checks, type checking, lint, and Ruff. Configure auto-merge without adding unrelated review requirements. New runner isolation and extra secret scanners are not prerequisites.
Do not claim a queued job executed or a branch-only file is installed.

## Helpers

- ACS: `3a381eba11c6262c702f5d696878c371342e859a`.
- PCM: `4e2385474b4af9249ca009cbdcb38c4498932475`.
- CGM 0.5.12: `6831f91e165b62d719c05eb492f7375fa932b560`, all eight modules.

Use helper coordination and continuity to support delivery. The owner retains product authority.
Use multiple Luna workers for independent work where available; the main agent integrates and verifies results.

## Product scope

Keep the control dashboard (#3), gallery (#5), and operations page (#8). Do not prescribe a frontend framework, library, template, or design tool; the owner chooses the implementation and visual direction. Dark mode is preferred by default, with interchangeable design systems. Supabase/provider consoles complement these views.
Transcript capture (#15) and planning projections (#18) are supporting work, not blockers for #3.
Provider onboarding (#16) uses normal runtime configuration when #4/#7 need it. Keep credentials out of Git and browser output; do not add a secret-management subsystem or scanner requirement.
