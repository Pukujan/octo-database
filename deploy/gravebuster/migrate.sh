# Octo Migration Runner (Gravebuster)
#
# Applies the canonical migrations in supabase/migrations/ to the live database and
# records each in octo.schema_migrations, so a deploy brings the schema up to the
# code it is about to run. deploy.sh calls this before starting the API; without it
# a deploy could run new code against an old schema (the drift that once broke
# production login).
#
# Each migration runs in one transaction together with its tracking insert, so a
# failure leaves neither a half-applied migration nor a false "applied" row. The
# migrations contain no top-level BEGIN/COMMIT and nothing that cannot run inside a
# transaction, so wrapping them this way is safe.
#
# Adoption: a database that predates this tracking table has no rows in it, so a
# plain run would try to re-apply already-applied migrations and fail on the
# non-idempotent ones (plain CREATE POLICY). For that one-time case set
# MIGRATE_BASELINE=1 to record every present migration as applied without running
# it — only when the tracking table is empty. Confirm the schema is already current
# before using it.
#
# Baseline against the migration set the database ALREADY has — the commit that
# created it — never the set you are about to deploy. MIGRATE_BASELINE records every
# file in MIGRATIONS_DIR, so baselining from a checkout that also contains a new
# migration records that new migration as applied, and it is then skipped forever
# (the schema silently drifts behind the code). To adopt a database created by commit
# C while deploying D: check out C, run the baseline there, then deploy D so this
# runner applies only what D adds. See docs/self-hosting.md § 3a.
