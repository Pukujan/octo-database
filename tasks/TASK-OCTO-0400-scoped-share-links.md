- Status: completed
- Priority: P1
- Branch: `task/OCTO-0400-scoped-share-links`
- GitHub issue: https://github.com/Pukujan/octo-database/issues/6

## Goal

Allow an owner to share exactly one album through a scoped link without granting access to the admin console or the rest of the workspace. Read-only is the v1 default; upload sharing must be requested explicitly.

## Prepared on this branch

- Migration `supabase/migrations/20261001020000_slice4_scoped_shares.sql` defining `octo.shares`
  with owner/admin RLS, a token-hash-only record, and a `SECURITY DEFINER` `octo.resolve_share`.
- Share service `src/media/share-service.ts` (token hashing, constant-time comparison, activity
  evaluation, audit redaction).
- Share-scoped media signing in `src/media/media-token.ts`, capped at the share's own expiry.
- Server routes: `POST/GET /api/workspaces/shares`, `DELETE /api/shares/:id`,
  anonymous `GET /api/public/shares/:token`.
- Standalone public viewer `src/ui/PublicShareView.tsx` routed at `/share/<token>`.
- Share management card in `src/ui/Dashboard.tsx`.
- Tests: `tests/unit/share-service.test.ts`, `tests/security/share-scope.test.ts`,
  `tests/e2e/shares.spec.ts`.

## Design notes

- Only a SHA-256 hash of the token is stored, so a database read cannot reconstruct a live link.
- The raw token is returned exactly once at creation and is never logged; audit output uses a
  redacted prefix.
- Media URLs signed for a share carry no principal and are capped at the share's expiry, so
  revoking or expiring a link also invalidates the media it served.
- Unknown, revoked, not-yet-valid, and expired links all return the same 404, so responses cannot
  be used to probe which links ever existed.

Completed:
- Scoped read-only share links with revocation, expiry, and share-scoped media signing

Evidence:
- Live run: anonymous access returned the shared album with 1 item and a 200 media fetch (306 bytes derivative)
- Live run: forged token 404; after revoke the share returned 404 and the previously valid media URL returned 401
- Live run: not-yet-valid share 404; anonymous workspace, key, and file routes all 401
- Playwright: logged-out recipient sees only the album and revocation is immediate
- 40 unit/integration/security tests pass

Decisions:
- Store only the token hash and return the raw token once
- Cap share-signed media URLs at the share expiry so revocation also kills media
- Return an identical 404 for unknown, revoked, and expired links to prevent probing

Changed:
- supabase/migrations/20261001020000_slice4_scoped_shares.sql
- src/media/share-service.ts
- src/media/media-token.ts
- src/ui/PublicShareView.tsx
- src/ui/Dashboard.tsx
- src/server/index.ts
- tests/e2e/shares.spec.ts

Blocked/uncertain:
- none

Next:
- Merge PR after green gates, then continue with the next accepted slice

Completed (defects found and fixed while verifying):
- A past `validUntil` surfaced the database check constraint as a 500; it is now a clear 400.
- A malformed bearer token reached a `uuid` cast and returned 500 instead of 401; tokens are now shape-checked before querying.
- Renumbered the Playwright/vision task from OCTO-0400 to OCTO-0080, since issue #6 assigns OCTO-0400 to Slice 4 and task IDs are the stable handle across issues, tasks, and checkpoints.

Decisions:
- Record the merge in the task and advance the current projection rather than leaving Slice 4 marked in review

Next:
- Begin the next accepted slice after this closeout.
