## Goal

Make auto-merge fully automatic for every agent, with no extra approval requirement and no manual
rebasing step.

## Owner instruction

"make sure auto merge is enabled and every agent does it automatically without extra approval
requirement"

## Applied configuration

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Repository `allow_auto_merge` | enabled |
| `main` required status checks | `gates` only |
| Required pull-request reviews | none |
| "Require branches to be up to date" (`strict`) | **off** |
| `delete_branch_on_merge` | enabled |
| `allow_update_branch` | enabled |
| `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml` | arms squash auto-merge on every same-repo PR |

The `strict` change matters: with it on, every PR had to be rebased onto `main` after any other
merge before auto-merge could complete, which produced a manual step on nearly every slice.

Completed:
- Hands-off auto-merge: strict up-to-date requirement removed and policy made explicit

Evidence:
- `gh api` branch protection shows `strict=false` and contexts `[gates]`
- PR #34 merged automatically after the change, with no manual merge step
- Repository settings show `allow_auto_merge=true`, `delete_branch_on_merge=true`, `allow_update_branch=true`

Decisions:
- Turn off "require branches to be up to date" so auto-merge completes without manual rebasing
- Keep `gates` as the only required check and require no review approval

Changed:
- AGENTS.md
- checkpoints/CURRENT.md

Blocked/uncertain:
- none

Next:
- Continue with the next accepted slice
