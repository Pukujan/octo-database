- Status: completed
- Priority: P1
- Branch: `task/OCTO-0050-credential-contract`
- GitHub issue: https://github.com/Pukujan/octo-database/issues/16

## Goal

Define and verify the runtime secret boundary for Google Drive and Cloudflare R2 without receiving or storing credential values in GitHub.

## Prepared on this branch

- Blank `.env.example` documenting environment variable names only
- Runtime secrets architecture guide: `docs/security/RUNTIME_SECRETS.md`
- Live verified R2 connection against dedicated `octo` bucket using server-side credentials
- `.gitignore` verification ensuring `.env` and credential files are never committed

## Checkpoint log

Verified live S3 API connectivity against Cloudflare R2 dedicated `octo` bucket.
Confirmed zero credential values in Git history or client bundles.
