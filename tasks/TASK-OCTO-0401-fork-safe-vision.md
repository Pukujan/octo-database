## Goal

The vision audit added in OCTO-0080 runs inside the required `gates` job. Fork pull requests never receive repository secrets, so `INFERHUB_API_KEY` is absent there by design, and the audit's assertions would fail every fork PR on a dependency that cannot be satisfied. Extract the audit so it skips with an explicit reason where the key cannot exist, while every same-repo run keeps performing and asserting the real audit.

## Prepared on this branch

- `tests/e2e/vision-audit.ts`: shared helper exposing `visionAuditAvailable()` and `auditPage(page, screenName)`, which returns `null` (and logs the reason) when the credential is unavailable.
- `tests/e2e/dashboard-ui.spec.ts`: switched to `auditPage`, asserting the vision score only when a result is returned.
- Deliberately does not use `pull_request_target`, because checking out untrusted PR code with secrets present is a standard exfiltration footgun.

Completed:
- Fork-safe multimodal vision audit that skips with a logged reason when the InferHub key is unavailable

Evidence:
- PR #28 merged into main as 284f990 with green gates (run 36813769358)
- Local run with the key present: all 3 E2E specs pass with the vision audit reporting model, score, and notes for the login screen and the dashboard

Decisions:
- Skip the audit where the secret cannot exist rather than fail an unsatisfiable required check
- Do not adopt pull_request_target, which would run untrusted PR code with secrets present

Changed:
- tests/e2e/vision-audit.ts
- tests/e2e/dashboard-ui.spec.ts

Blocked/uncertain:
- none

Next:
- Continue with the next accepted slice (#6 scoped share links)
