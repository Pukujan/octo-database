- Status: completed
- Priority: P1
- Branch: `task/OCTO-0100-google-login-workspace-dashboard`
- GitHub issue: https://github.com/Pukujan/octo-database/issues/3

## Goal

Deliver the first real product path: Google sign-in → Octo identity → authorized workspace list → private workspace dashboard. This slice establishes the principal/workspace boundary every later file, gallery, agent, and analytics feature depends on.

## Prepared on this branch

- Canonical PostgreSQL migration with Row-Level Security: `supabase/migrations/20261001000000_slice1_principals_workspaces_memberships.sql`
- Supabase Auth session lifecycle & Google OAuth: `src/auth/session.ts`
- Database-backed authorization engine with RLS: `src/auth/authorization.ts`
- Workspace entry and membership service: `src/auth/workspace-service.ts`
- React MUI control dashboard with light theme: `src/ui/Dashboard.tsx` and `src/ui/theme.ts`
- Full test suite: unit, integration, security-negative, and SQL schema validation
