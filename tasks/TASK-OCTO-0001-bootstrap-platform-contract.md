- Status: completed
- Priority: P0
- Branch: `task/OCTO-0001-bootstrap-platform-contract`
- GitHub issue: https://github.com/Pukujan/octo-database/issues/2

## Goal

Install usable PCM, CGM, and ACS adopter contracts and run genuine gates on GitHub-hosted ubuntu-latest.

## Prepared on this branch

PCM continuity files and pinned schemas, the full CGM eight-module adapter, ACS assignment state, owner policy, project goals and success conditions, and the `gates` workflow.

## Remaining work

Run PCM, CGM, and ACS checks on the final PR candidate using GitHub-hosted ubuntu-latest.
Fix demonstrated failures and merge after genuine green gates.
Enable owner-requested auto-merge and require genuine gates. Include integrity/integration validation, type checking, lint, and Ruff. Do not add unrelated review requirements.
Then begin #3; #15/#18 do not block product work.
