- Status: active
- Priority: P1
- Branch: `task/OCTO-0300-gallery`
- GitHub issue: https://github.com/Pukujan/octo-database/issues/5

## Goal

Build the first polished user-facing application: a private image/video gallery over the existing workspace/file APIs. Family/personal users can browse albums visually, load thumbnails quickly, open full images, and play browser-supported videos without seeing infrastructure or admin controls.

## Prepared on this branch

- Task definition and acceptance criteria aligned with GitHub Issue #5 (Slice 3).
- Media query and thumbnail derivation specifications.

## Checkpoint log

Task initialized following successful merge of Slice 5 (PR #24: Google Drive archival, R2 guest storage verification, and CGM hero asset).
Next step is to create the gallery UI component, media query routes, and thumbnail generator.

Completed:
- Private workspace gallery with derivative thumbnails, signed media URLs, and modal lightbox

Evidence:
- Browser run: grid loaded a 400x300 WebP derivative while the lightbox loaded the 1000x700 original with zero failed requests
- Thumbnail service tests: one derivative written across repeated calls
- Gallery integration test: unauthorized principal receives FORBIDDEN
- Playwright gallery spec passes; vision audit scored login 90/100 and dashboard 90/100

Decisions:
- Derive thumbnails at a stable key so regeneration is idempotent
- Sign media URLs because img/video tags cannot send Authorization headers
- Require explicit OCTO_STORAGE_BACKEND=local so production still fails closed without R2

Changed:
- src/media
- src/storage/object-store.ts
- src/ui/Gallery.tsx
- src/server/index.ts
- tests/e2e/gallery.spec.ts
- tests/integration/gallery.test.ts
- tests/unit/media-classifier.test.ts
- tests/unit/thumbnail-service.test.ts

Blocked/uncertain:
- none

Next:
- Merge PR #27 after green gates, then begin scoped share links (#6)

Completed (defects found and fixed while verifying):
- Base64 upload payloads were stored as text rather than decoded bytes, corrupting every uploaded image.
- The local download fallback returned its own endpoint; replaced with a real `/api/files/content` route.
- The implicit local storage fallback was replaced with an explicit opt-in so production fails closed.
- The Google sign-in button linked to a nonexistent route; it now reports an honest not-configured state.
