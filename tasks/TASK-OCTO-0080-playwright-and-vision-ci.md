- Status: completed
- Priority: P1
- Branch: `task/OCTO-0400-playwright-and-vision-ci` (historical; renumbered to OCTO-0080 so slice IDs stay aligned with their issues)
- GitHub issue: https://github.com/Pukujan/octo-database/issues/3

## Goal

Setup Playwright E2E testing and automated multimodal vision verification using Alibaba Qwen 3.8 Flash via InferHub in GitHub Actions CI, auditing UI/UX layout, padding, alignment, and visual appeal per CGM guidelines.

## Prepared on this branch

- Multimodal vision verifier `src/qa/vision-verifier.ts` using `ali/qwen3.8-flash` with automatic fallback to `ali/qwen3.8-omni-flash`
- Playwright E2E test suite `tests/e2e/dashboard-ui.spec.ts` capturing full-page screenshots and executing vision audits
- Playwright configuration `playwright.config.ts` managing Vite (port 3000) and backend server (port 3001) lifecycle
- Dashboard enhanced with CGM visual guidelines (`src/ui/Dashboard.tsx`) with login vector illustration and spacious alignment
- GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/gates.yml` configured with `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium` and `npx playwright test` using repository secret `INFERHUB_API_KEY`
