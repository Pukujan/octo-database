- Status: completed
- Priority: P1
- Branch: `task/OCTO-0600-operations-page`
- GitHub issue: https://github.com/Pukujan/octo-database/issues/8

## Goal

Create a minimal operational model for background work so thumbnails, archive/restore, and later agent/data jobs are observable and retryable, with idempotency that survives worker interruption.

## Prepared on this branch

- Migration `supabase/migrations/20261001030000_slice6_jobs_and_activity.sql` defining `octo.jobs`,
  `octo.activity`, member-only RLS, and a lease-based `octo.claim_job` using `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`.
- Job service `src/jobs/job-service.ts` (state machine, idempotent enqueue, retry with backoff, activity).
- Worker `src/jobs/worker.ts` (lease claim, handler dispatch, convergence on crash).
- Server routes: `POST/GET /api/jobs`, `POST /api/jobs/:id/retry`, `POST /api/jobs/run`,
  `GET /api/activity`.
- Operations page `src/ui/OperationsPage.tsx`, wired into the dashboard.
- Tests: `tests/unit/job-state.test.ts`, `tests/integration/job-worker.test.ts`,
  `tests/e2e/operations.spec.ts`.

## Design notes

- States are explicit and monotonic where possible: `queued → running → completed`, with retryable
  failure returning through a controlled `running → queued` transition. Terminal states never move.
- Idempotency is enforced by a unique `(workspace_id, job_type, idempotency_key)` constraint, so a
  repeated enqueue returns the original row rather than a second logical job.
- `claim_job` uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, so exactly one worker receives a given job.
- Recovery is lease-based: a crashed worker stops renewing its lease and the job becomes claimable
  again, rather than being lost or silently duplicated.
- Side effects are keyed by job identity, so re-running after a crash reuses the existing derivative.

Completed:
- Durable job queue with lease-based recovery, retry accounting, and an operations page

Evidence:
- Live run: duplicate idempotency key returned created=false and the workspace still had exactly 1 job
- Live run: worker pass completed the job (attempt 1) and activity recorded enqueue plus transition
- Live crash drill: the job was claimed by a worker that never returned and stayed running with a lease; after lease expiry a new pass reclaimed it and completed it (attempt 2) with exactly 1 derivative on disk
- Live run: unauthorized workspace job access returned 403, anonymous returned 401
- 51 unit/integration tests and 2 Playwright operations tests pass

Decisions:
- Enforce idempotency with a unique key constraint rather than application-side dedupe
- Use FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED with a lease so a crashed worker's job is reclaimed
- Treat malformed payloads as permanent failures so they cannot retry forever
