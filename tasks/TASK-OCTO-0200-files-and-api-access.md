## Prepared on this branch

- Migration `supabase/migrations/20261001010000_slice2_files_and_api_keys.sql` defining `octo.files`, `octo.api_keys`, and SECURITY DEFINER RPC verification
- Cloudflare R2 active storage provider `src/storage/r2-client.ts` with S3Client
- Logical file catalog service `src/storage/file-service.ts`
- Guest authentication lifecycle `src/auth/session.ts`
- API key engine `src/api/keys.ts` and unified gateway `src/api/gateway.ts`
- React MUI control dashboard with files catalog and API key generator `src/ui/Dashboard.tsx`
- Complete test suites for R2 storage, files catalog, guest login, and API keys
