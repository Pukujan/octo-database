- Status: active
- Priority: P1
- Branch: `task/OCTO-1000-gravebuster-hosting`
- GitHub issue: https://github.com/Pukujan/octo-database/issues/43
- Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-01-octo-gravebuster-deployment-design.md`

## Goal

Host Octo on gravebuster at `octodb.design-bakery.com`, with a CI/CD path that
cannot break the running service and a `production` branch the owner promotes to.

## Blocking defects this work must fix

1. `src/server/index.ts:465` sends users to Google with a callback redirect URI,
   but no `/api/auth/google/callback` route exists — Google sign-in is broken.
2. `src/server/index.ts` is API-only; nothing serves the Vite `dist/` build.
3. `url.origin` (line 436) derives from a hardcoded `http://localhost:${PORT}`
   base, so the redirect URI is wrong behind the tunnel.
4. The server reads `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`/`_SECRET`; the repo `.env` defines
   `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

## Owner-confirmed decisions

Dedicated Postgres container; keep `main`, add `production`; promotion via a PR
from `main` merged by the owner; pull-based systemd deploy timer; secrets copied
to gravebuster over SSH; Podman for the WSL test stack; reuse the existing Google
client and implement the missing callback.

## Owner actions required

- Add `https://octodb.design-bakery.com/api/auth/google/callback` as an authorized
  redirect URI on the existing Google OAuth client.
- Add the tunnel hostname in the Zero Trust dashboard; the repo's Cloudflare
  tokens both fail `/user/tokens/verify` with error code 1000.
- Confirm port 8090 is free on gravebuster.

## Not in scope

Schema-migration tooling for a live database, scale-out (Issue #14), rotating the
expired Cloudflare tokens.

Decisions:
- Dedicated Postgres container on gravebuster
- Keep main, add production branch promoted by owner PR
- Pull-based systemd deploy timer polling origin/production

Completed:
- Implemented Google OAuth callback, /api/me endpoint, frontend fragment pickup, public origin resolution, static file serving, and gravebuster Docker Compose stack

Evidence:
- 112 Vitest tests pass across 20 files
- tsc --noEmit passes
- JSON contract integrity passes (18 contracts)
- 55 python unit tests pass
- PCM validate and CGM validate pass

Decisions:
- Use deterministic UUID derived from Google sub to satisfy Postgres UUID auth_user_id
- Serve Vite dist as static fallback in Node server and via Caddy in gravebuster compose
- Support both GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID seamlessly

Completed:
- Mounted 01-apply-migrations.sh to execute migrations on Postgres container init
- Removed invalid User= directive from systemd user service unit
- Fixed static asset serving path traversal check and excluded /api/ routes from SPA fallback
- Purged stale tokens in frontend on 401 response from /api/me
- Added test coverage for forwarded headers and 404 JSON handling

Evidence:
- 115 Vitest tests pass across 20 files
- tsc --noEmit passes
- 55 python unit tests pass
- JSON contract integrity passes (18 contracts)
- PCM validate passes

Decisions:
- Explicitly execute /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/migrations/*.sql via 01-apply-migrations.sh since Postgres does not recurse into subdirectories
- Keep user service units without User= directive per systemd standard
