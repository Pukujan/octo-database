- Status: active
- Priority: P1
- Branch: `task/OCTO-0700-agent-capabilities`
- GitHub issue: https://github.com/Pukujan/octo-database/issues/9

## Goal

Give AI agents and automation scoped machine identities that use the same Octo platform boundary as human-facing apps. A token proves a principal and its capabilities; it never carries infrastructure master credentials.

## Prepared on this branch

- Capability discovery `src/api/capabilities.ts` (stable action list, scope filtering, auth guidance).
- Scope enforcement on every agent-callable route in `src/server/index.ts`.
- `GET /api/capabilities` filtered to the presented token's scopes.
- `DELETE /api/keys/:id` so a leaked agent token can actually be withdrawn.
- Explicit scope selection at mint time; unknown scopes rejected with 400.
- Agent action attribution into the activity feed.
- Tests: `tests/unit/capabilities.test.ts`, `tests/security/agent-scopes.test.ts`,
  `tests/e2e/agent-tokens.spec.ts`.

## Design notes

- Capability discovery describes **how** to call Octo; token scopes define **what** the
  principal may do. The description is never the enforcement mechanism -- every call is
  authorized server-side against the token's scopes.
- The default scope set is non-destructive (`read`, `write`, `files`); `delete` and
  `admin` must be requested explicitly, so a token cannot be destructive by omission.
- Human sessions are not scope-limited; only API-key callers are.
- Enforcement is server-side on token scopes, so text inside a retrieved document cannot
  escalate authority (covered by the indirect prompt-injection test).

Completed:
- Scoped agent tokens with capability discovery, server-side scope enforcement, audit attribution, and revocation

Evidence:
- Live: a read-only token discovered 5 read/files actions and listed files (200)
- Live: the same token was refused delete (403) and upload (403)
- Live: the token could not reach another workspace (403)
- Live: the capability payload contained 0 infrastructure credential strings
- Live: agent upload and delete actions were attributed in the activity feed
- Live: after DELETE /api/keys/:id the token returned 401; revoking a non-owned key returned 404
- Live: an unknown scope was rejected at mint time (400)
- 62 unit/security tests and 2 agent E2E tests pass

Decisions:
- Default scopes exclude delete and admin so a token is never destructive by omission
- Capability discovery is filtered to granted scopes but enforcement stays server-side
- Add DELETE /api/keys/:id because a token that cannot be revoked is a liability

Changed:
- src/api/capabilities.ts
- src/server/index.ts
- tests/e2e/agent-tokens.spec.ts
- tests/security/agent-scopes.test.ts
- tests/unit/capabilities.test.ts

Blocked/uncertain:
- none

Next:
- Merge PR after green gates, then continue with the next accepted slice
