# Octo UI direction

Owner correction recorded on [issue #74](https://github.com/Pukujan/octo-database/issues/74#issuecomment-5965479948), 2026-10-03.

## Product surface

Octo is a workspace portal for people and agents working with durable files and workspace activity. Its frontend focuses on the jobs that need an Octo-specific surface:

- workspace overview and selection;
- file browsing, upload, download, archive, restore, and removal;
- image and video gallery;
- background job review and retry;
- workspace API keys and share links.

Provider and database administration stays in the provider's own console. Show real workspace data and available actions; do not invent infrastructure status or analytics.

## Visual direction

- Start fresh. The previous dashboard is only a record of existing behavior, not a layout, style, or component template to preserve.
- Dark appearance is the default. Keep the visual system interchangeable; an alternate light appearance may be offered.
- Use clear hierarchy, generous spacing, one focused job per view, and imagery only where it helps browse actual workspace media.
- The interface must work at desktop and mobile widths, with visible keyboard focus.

## Workspace views

| View | Primary job |
| --- | --- |
| Overview | Understand the current workspace, see recently added files and activity, and reach the next useful action. |
| Files | Find, upload, download, archive, restore, or remove a file. |
| Gallery | Browse actual workspace images and video in a visual layout. |
| Operations | Find failed jobs, understand the failure, retry, and review recent activity. |
| Access | Manage workspace API keys, share links, and workspace details. |

## Behavior boundary

Keep the existing API and storage callbacks as the data/action boundary. A visual rebuild may replace the previous page structure and decorative assets, but it must not change the server's authorization or provider behavior. Preserve the public read-only share route and its standalone viewer.

## Research workflow

The owner may choose any design tool, implementation stack, and visual system. Keep the same workspace data and actions across design iterations; owner taste decides visual quality.

For the owner-requested Dyad dashboard experiment, use [the Dyad dashboard brief](frontend/DYAD_DASHBOARD_BRIEF.md). It separates current API behavior from proposed quota and observability contracts so a prototype cannot mistake sample data for production capability.
